# Reflections

#### Week 1

I came into this class with little expectations on what digital writing consisted of. The definition of digital writing - relying on computation for the work to be realised, made sense, and wasn't untill we had viewed examples that I conceptualised that the writing material is almost secondary to the coding or animation of the work. I am lucky to be old enough to have used MySpace back in the day, using a little bit of html to create a page. The readings have been quite dense and a little overwhelming at times. I'm not too sure how much of it we are expected to read and understand, I'm hoping that the understanding of the exercises will carry me through this semester.

#### Week 2

I enjoyed viewing the eliterature collection to get a sense of what type of work we could/ are expected to produce for our final works. I was quite surpised at the temporarlity of digital writing, due to the everchanging software and hardware obsoletion we experience. Alot of the work in the first two volumes of the e-lit collection would not load, as the script generator used to run these works had become obsolete. This harkened the digital writings temporality to street art. Perhaps these are not supposed to be permanent, which enhances the experience of the viewer, being lucky enough to have stumbled across these pieces when they exisisted. Benjamin had spoken of researches hoping to archive these pieces by ressurectin the obsolete programs, or to make an equivalent program that would run the code.
I enjoyed the works that took a minimilast approach, the text being the centre piece, only to be complimented by the coding to embelish features or add symbolism to the work. Viewing the code of Taroko Gorge in Github, and learning how to use github made me feel more competent and less anxious about our final task. I know that I can use the skeleton html of digital pieces to start as a framework for a new piece. I also enjoyed how the digital writing community is very open to the concept of "Remixing" their work, some only asking for crediting to the original work to exist in the coding, others not asking for creditation at all. I think this reveals the sense of community in the digital realms.

#### Week 4 

This class was a really long stretch mentally. Half the day consisted of class presentations, which gave me some really good Ideas about potential concepts for my work. 
I enjoyed Lauren's piece of animated concrete poetry, which gave me some good ideas for my static conrcrete works. I think even though the day was a huge slog, it was worth it to see the different points of interest in digital writing for the class. Also some good discussions were generated at the end of each talk, which gave me some further ideas. Finally being able to remix some works (I had a go at a remix of Taroko Gorge at the end of week 2) instilled further confidence that I was grasping the coding, even walking out on my own to attempt to add images which were not guided by Benjamin was fun, even if it didn't end up exactly how I wanted it to. I'm pretty keen to try out bitsy, I have an idea to create an interactive piece/ game on mental health, displaying the tribulations and failures of the health care system. 

#### Week 5

This weeks class involved the creation of a basic website that used html formatting. I struggled to implement the coding successfully, perhaps due to some minute errors in the coding, or the operating system I was using. 

#### Week 6

We received feedback on our presentations and worked more on stylising in Twine. I'm hoping that I've learned enough to make a competent twin fiction piece now.

#### Week 9 

Today we mainly worked on our Folio and Creative pieces. I feel like i'm quite behind in producing my work, and trying to recall all of the procedures to produce a decent Twine work has been challenging.

#### Week 10 Conclusion

The culmination of weeks of exercises learning how to code have lead me to finalise my creative work. I can see now the importance of expermenting with various platforms to create digital work, which leaves traditional literature at a stark contrast. There are few, viable options when it comes to word processors and analog mediums. 

I think Stasis chambers was well executed given the time restraints. Collectively, we didn't really start working on our final projects untill halfway through the semester. With the general consensus being limited with their experience of digital writing, it would of been nice to have a bit more time to familiarise ourselves with our selected platform to produce more stylised works. I do however, understand the time restraints were reasonable and the most effective delivery method, as there was a lot of essential theories and basics to digest first. My aim this semeseter was to tap back in to personal writing and find a way to tell this story in an accessible way. I think Stasis Chambers conveyed what I was struggling to, and the overall experience creating this work makes me beleive I have learned a new and valuable skill, that I will return to using in the future. My biggest challenge this semester unsurprisingly, was creating a work about hidden illness under time restraints, whilst experienceing the same thing.
