# Reflections

#### Week 1

I came into this class with little expecations on what digital writing consisted of. The definition of digital writing - relying on computation for the work to be realised, made sense, and wasn't untill we had viewed examples that I conceptualised that the writing material is almost secondary to the coding or animation of the work. I am lucky to be old enough to have used MySpace back in the day, using a little bit of html to create a page. The readings have been quite dense and a little overwhelming at times. I'm not too sure how much of it we are expected to read and understand, I'm hoping that the understanding of the exercises will carry me through this semester.

#### Week 2

I enjoyed viewing the eliterature collection to get a sense of what type of work we could/ are expected to produce for our final works. I was quite surpised at the temporarlity of digital writing, due to the everchanging software and hardware obsoletion we experience. Alot of the work in the first two volumes of the e-lit collection would not load, as the script generator used to run these works had become obsolete. This harkened the digital writings temporality to street art. Perhaps these are not supposed to be permanent, which enhances the experience of the viewer, being lucky enough to have stumbled across these pieces when they exisisted. Benjamin had spoken of researches hoping to archive these pieces by ressurectin the obsolete programs, or to make an equivalent program that would run the code.
